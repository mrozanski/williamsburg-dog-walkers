# Mobile Navigation Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Convert existing desktop navigation bar to mobile-first responsive design while preserving desktop functionality.
### Note on existing code:
- The existing code is in the `index.html` file.
- The existing CSS is in the `styles.css` file.
- The existing JavaScript is in the `script.js` file.
- The existing images are in the `images` folder.
- The existing logo is in the `logo.png` file.
- The existing HTML structure is in the `index.html` file.
The existing navigation bar is in the `index.html` file, the contents of the links should be the same as the desktop navigation bar.

```html
<!-- Navigation -->
    <nav class="navbar">
```

If needed, create new elements for the mobile navigation bar and use breakpoints to hide and show the navigation bar that corresponds to the current screen size.
Minor improvements/cleanups to the desktop nav bar are allowed as long as functionality is preserved.



## Technical Constraints
- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only
- No server-side code or frameworks
- 3rd party JS libraries allowed for specific UI functionalities if needed
- Must maintain existing desktop navigation layout and functionality

## Mobile Design Requirements

### Breakpoint and Container
- **Breakpoint**: Apply mobile styles for screens smaller than desktop (recommend max-width: 980px)
- **Container width**: 80% width with max-width of 1080px
- **Container positioning**: Centered horizontally

### Logo Specifications
- **Size**: 70x70px
- **Position**: Left-aligned within navigation container
- **Vertical alignment**: Centered within navigation bar
Use the existing logo.png file for the logo.

### Hamburger Menu Icon
- **Size**: Approximately 60px height
- **Position**: Right-aligned within navigation container
- **Vertical alignment**: Centered within navigation bar
- **Style**: Standard hamburger icon (three horizontal lines)
- **State**: Should have visual feedback on tap/hover

SVG/CSS is acceptable for the hamburger menu icon.

### Navigation Links Behavior
- **Default state**: Hidden on mobile screens
- **Toggle mechanism**: Show/hide via hamburger menu icon tap
- **Animation**: Slide down animation when opening
- **Animation reverse**: Slide up when closing
- **Layout**: Stack navigation items vertically in dropdown
- **Positioning**: Dropdown should appear below the navigation bar

## Functionality Requirements

### Interactive Elements
1. **Hamburger menu toggle**
   - Tap to open navigation dropdown
   - Tap again to close navigation dropdown
   - Should work with touch events on mobile

2. **Animation specifications**
   - Smooth slide down transition (recommend 300-400ms duration)
   - Smooth slide up transition when closing
   - Use CSS transitions or animations (avoid jQuery-style animations)

3. **Accessibility considerations**
   - Proper ARIA labels for hamburger menu button
   - Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space to toggle)
   - Screen reader friendly

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop screens**: Preserve existing navigation layout and functionality unchanged
- **Mobile screens**: Implement hamburger menu system as described
- **Transition handling**: Ensure proper layout switching between breakpoints

## Implementation Guidelines

### CSS Structure
- Use media queries to separate mobile and desktop styles
- Mobile-first approach: base styles for mobile, then desktop overrides
- Ensure no conflicts between mobile and desktop navigation styles

### JavaScript Requirements
- Event listeners for hamburger menu toggle
- Animation control (CSS classes or direct style manipulation)
- Proper cleanup of event listeners if needed
- Handle both click and touch events

### File Organization
- Keep existing HTML structure intact where possible
- Add necessary classes/IDs for mobile functionality without breaking desktop
- Organize CSS with clear separation between mobile and desktop rules

## Deliverables Expected
1. Updated HTML with any necessary structural changes
2. CSS with mobile-first responsive navigation styles
3. JavaScript for hamburger menu functionality and animations
4. Documentation of any changes made to existing desktop code

## Testing Requirements
- Test on various mobile screen sizes (320px to 980px width)
- Verify desktop functionality remains unchanged
- Test animation smoothness and performance
- Verify touch interactions work properly on mobile devices
- Test keyboard accessibility

## Desktop Navigation Code Changes (Implementation Documentation - Cursor AI)

- Added a hamburger menu button (with ARIA attributes) to the navigation bar for mobile screens.
- Updated the navigation container to use flexbox for better alignment and responsiveness.
- The logo is now always left-aligned and sized to 70x70px for mobile.
- The hamburger menu is right-aligned and only visible on screens <= 980px.
- The navigation links (`nav-menu`) are hidden by default on mobile and shown as a dropdown when the hamburger is toggled.
- Slide down/up animation for the dropdown is handled via CSS transitions.
- Desktop navigation layout and functionality remain unchanged for screens > 980px, with only minor improvements to alignment and structure for maintainability.
- All changes are backward compatible and do not break existing desktop navigation behavior.
